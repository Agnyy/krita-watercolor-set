====================

Created for and with Krita 2.8

Making this Set of Brushes for Digital Painting with the touch of simulated watercolors was a challenge i set for myself. In my eyes watercolors are one of the most difficult disciplines to learn in traditional painting. Making tools that simulate this dynamics is as difficult. I am not very experienced in aquarelle painting, therefor it is hard to say how good this tools do their job. I have done research, compared it with other brushsets (e.g in mypaint and corel painter), scanned images of watercolor, looked at watercolor paintings  from traditional masters - so i can say i have done my homework and did the best i can, to provide you with a nice brushset to create stunning watercolor paintings! Feedback is always welcome.

The basic idea behind the presets is to simulate and control the diffusion of water by pressure with scatter and rotation settings combined with opacity and colorchange-rate. More pressure - more scatter less opacity - this is the basic formula. All brushes are set to a relative low size ~30-100 pixels, but from my testing i can say that all work and look good in a range of 50%-200% of the base.
